In this blog post I'd like to present [toykio](https://github.com/polachok/toykio), a simple futures executor intended for learning about how executors with an event loop work. Toykio only provides a very minimal feature set: An event loop and TCP streams and listners. However, it turns out that due to the fact that futures are composable, this is enough to build complex clients and servers.

In the following, I'd like to give you a quick overview of toykio's components.

## `AsyncTcpStream`

Tokio defines the `AsyncTcpStream` type, a newtype wrapper around `TcpStream` from the standard library. Just like in std, the `connect` function opens a connection, and sets the socket to non-blocking mode. This means that the `read()` and `write()` methods will return immediately, either with data or an error. If there's not enough data (for reads) or buffer space (for writes) avaialble, a special kind of error - `WouldBlock` - is returned. We'll discuss how to handle it in the next section.

## `AsyncRead` & `AsyncWrite`
The `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite` traits are the foundation of all I/O futures. The `AsyncReadExt` and `AsyncWriteExt`
extension methods (like `write_all`) are built on top of them. These traits provide a way to connect futures to an event loop while keeping them independent from any particular event loop implementation.

Let's take a look at the [AsyncRead](https://github.com/polachok/toykio/blob/futures-0.3/src/lib.rs#L327) implementation for `AsyncTcpStream`:

```rust
impl AsyncRead for AsyncTcpStream {
    fn poll_read(&mut self, cx: &mut Context, buf: &mut [u8]) -> Poll<Result<usize, Error>> {
        match self.0.read(buf) {
            Ok(len) => Poll::Ready(Ok(len)),
            Err(ref err) if err.kind() == std::io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock => {
                // Get TcpStream file descriptor
                let fd = self.0.as_raw_fd();
                let waker = cx.waker();

                REACTOR.with(|reactor| reactor.add_read_interest(fd, waker.clone()));

                Poll::Pending
            }
            Err(err) => panic!("error {:?}", err),
        }
    }
}
```
It tries to perform a read on the underlying `TcpStream` and if the read succeeds, the slice will be filled with data. If however the read fails with a `WouldBlock` error, then it registers its interest so that it gets notified when the data becomes available. More about this in the next section.

The [AsyncWrite](https://github.com/polachok/toykio/blob/futures-0.3/src/lib.rs#L346) implementation does something analogous for writes.

## Event loop
The [`event loop`](https://github.com/polachok/toykio/blob/futures-0.3/src/lib.rs#L108)
(often also called "reactor") is the core of the executor. It is defined like this:

```rust
struct InnerEventLoop {
    read: RefCell<BTreeMap<RawFd, Waker>>,
    write: RefCell<BTreeMap<RawFd, Waker>>,
    counter: Cell<usize>,
    wait_queue: RefCell<BTreeMap<TaskId, Task>>,
    run_queue: RefCell<VecDeque<Wakeup>>,
}
```
- `read` and `write` are `BTreeMaps` which map file descriptors to wakers.
- `wait_queue` stores blocked tasks which wait for an event
- and `run_queue` stores wake-up notifications.

The event loop provides methods to [register](https://github.com/polachok/toykio/blob/futures-0.3/src/lib.rs#L133) (and remove) interest in read and write events. Let's look at what `add_read_interest` does:

```rust
fn add_read_interest(&self, fd: RawFd, waker: Waker) {
        if !self.read.borrow().contains_key(&fd) {
            self.read.borrow_mut().insert(fd, waker);
        }
}
```

But it just inserts `fd` and `waker` into the `read` map! So where does all the magic happen?
In the [main loop](https://github.com/polachok/toykio/blob/futures-0.3/src/lib.rs#L192).
The event loop is called a loop for a reason. Let's take a look:

```rust
loop {
    // Event loop iteration timeout. If no descriptor is ready we continue iterating
    let mut tv: timeval = timeval {
        tv_sec: 1,
        tv_usec: 0,
    };

    // Initialize fd_sets (file descriptor sets)
    let mut read_fds: fd_set = unsafe { std::mem::zeroed() };
    let mut write_fds: fd_set = unsafe { std::mem::zeroed() };

    unsafe { FD_ZERO(&mut read_fds) };
    unsafe { FD_ZERO(&mut write_fds) };
```
Woah, woah, a lot of `unsafe` here! Well, don't worry, it's just how C FFI works. We need to initialize some C structures, a timeout and `fd_set`s. They will be passed to the select(2) function later.

```rust
    // Add read interests to read fd_sets
    for fd in self.read.borrow().keys() {
        unsafe { FD_SET(*fd, &mut read_fds as *mut fd_set) };
        nfds = std::cmp::max(nfds, fd + 1);
    }

    // Add write interests to write fd_sets
    for fd in self.write.borrow().keys() {
        unsafe { FD_SET(*fd, &mut write_fds as *mut fd_set) };
        nfds = std::cmp::max(nfds, fd + 1);
    }
```
Here we add file descriptors from our `read` and `write` maps from before to the `fd_set`s.

```rust
    // `select` will block until some event happens on the fds or the timeout triggers
    let rv = unsafe {
        select(
            nfds,
            &mut read_fds,
            &mut write_fds,
            std::ptr::null_mut(),
            &mut tv,
        )
    };

    // Don't care for errors
    if rv == -1 {
	    panic!("select()");
    } else if rv == 0 {
	    debug!("timeout");
    } else {
	    debug!("data available on {} fds", rv);
    }
```
Finally we call `select` with arguments we prepared earlier. `select()` accepts 3 fd_sets (we ignore the third for this example) and a timeout and returns something non-zero in case one (or more) of the file descriptors in the sets are ready. We should then go and find which one it was!

```rust
    // Check which fd it was and put appropriate future on run queue
    for (fd, waker) in self.read.borrow().iter() {
        let is_set = unsafe { FD_ISSET(*fd, &mut read_fds as *mut fd_set) };
        if is_set {
            waker.wake();
        }
    }

    // Same for write
    for (fd, waker) in self.write.borrow().iter() {
        let is_set = unsafe { FD_ISSET(*fd, &mut write_fds as *mut fd_set) };
        if is_set {
            waker.wake();
        }
    }
```
We go through our maps again and check if they're set (ready) in fd_sets. When they are, we
call `wake` on their associated wakers, which in turn puts `Wakeup` events on the ready-to-run queue.

```rust
    let mut tasks_done = Vec::new();

    // Now pop tasks from the run queue and poll them
    while let Some(wakeup) = self.run_queue.borrow_mut().pop_front() {
        let mut handle = self.handle();

        if let Some(ref mut task) = self.wait_queue.borrow_mut().get_mut(wakeup.index) {
            // If a task returns `Poll::Ready`, we're done with it
            if task.poll(wakeup.waker, &mut handle).is_ready() {
                tasks_done.push(wakeup.index);
            }
        }
    }

    // Remove completed tasks
    for idx in tasks_done {
	    self.wait_queue.borrow_mut().remove(idx);
    }

    // Stop the loop if there are no more tasks in the `wait_queue`
    if self.wait_queue.borrow().is_empty() {
	    return;
    }
```
We drain the `run_queue`, retrieve the task index on the `wait_queue` and poll the tasks. Ready (done) tasks are removed from the wait_queue.

## The life of the future

In this section, I'd like to recap how a future (let's take `Read` for example) is executed on the event loop:

 - first it's created using `read()` method on AsyncTcpStream. This method is implemented for all types implementing `AsyncRead`.
 - then it's spawned on the executor, using either `run()` or `spawn()` method
 - the executor calls `poll()` method on the future. `poll` implementation for `Read` calls `poll_read()` on the `AsyncTcpStream`,
   which registers its interest in `readable` events
 - when an event occurs, future is polled again. This cycle is repeated until future is ready.

More complex futures, like `ReadToEnd` are built on top of primitive futures.
